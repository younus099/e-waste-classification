# ðŸ”Œ E-Waste Image Classification using EfficientNetV2B0

This is a basic deep learning project aimed at classifying different types of electronic waste using images. The model is built using **EfficientNetV2B0** and leverages **transfer learning** to speed up training and improve accuracy.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Electronic waste (e-waste) is a growing concern for the environment. Sorting these wastes manually is inefficient and error-prone. In this project, we use AI to automate this process by classifying e-waste images into 10 categories using a convolutional neural network.
