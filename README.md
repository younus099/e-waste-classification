# 🔌 E-Waste Image Classification using EfficientNetV2B0

This is a deep learning project focused on classifying different types of electronic waste using images. The model uses EfficientNetV2B0 with transfer learning to enhance accuracy while keeping training efficient.

## 📌 Project Overview

Electronic waste (e-waste) poses a serious environmental challenge. Manual classification is time-consuming and often inaccurate. This project automates the identification of e-waste items by classifying images into 10 predefined categories using a CNN-based image classifier.

## 🧠 Features

✅ EfficientNetV2B0 as a pre-trained base  
✅ Custom classification head with softmax output  
✅ Training, validation, and testing using `image_dataset_from_directory`  
✅ EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint callbacks  
✅ Evaluation with confusion matrix & classification report  
✅ Interactive Gradio interface for image prediction
